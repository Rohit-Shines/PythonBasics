# #Strings are also iterable objects, containing a sequence of characters:
# mystr = "banana"
# myit = iter(mystr)
#
# print(next(myit))
# print(next(myit))
# print(next(myit))
# print(next(myit))
# print(next(myit))
# print(next(myit))



# # All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:
# mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# myit = iter(mytuple)
#
# print(next(myit))
# print(next(myit))
# print(next(myit))
